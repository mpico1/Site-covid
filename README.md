# GAME

Hello, im trying to develop a simple 2Dgame in p5 js, i hope i enjoy it when it is done.
I know i'm doing this the hard way, but i don't like the easier versions out there, so i decided to make my own one
I'm still in the very begginer and im Portuguese, so sorry for any typos, I'm open to sugestons
